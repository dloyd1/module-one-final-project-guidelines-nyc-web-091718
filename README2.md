“In a dark place we find ourselves, and a little more knowledge lights our way.”

###Motivation###

It is a student Data Analytics Project testing the knowledge of the Object Oriented Programming, SQL and API.

1.In this project we are using Active Record to create and access Sqlite3 Database.

2.We have three models in our game. “Question” has many has many “QC”. “Choice” has many “QC”. “QC” is the join table. “QC” belongs to “Question” and “Choices”.

3.“Question” and “Choices” are our to-dos that we built in our CLI for user to have interactive experience.

4.We determine the models, set the relationships between this models and then we created databases of the models.
